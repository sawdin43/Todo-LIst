# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available for React + Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

To use this template, you can clone the repository and follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/sawdin43/Todo-LIst
.git
```
2. Navigate to the project's root directory:
```
cd Todo-LIst

```
3. Install the project dependencies:
```
npm install
```

## Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React + Vite application by running the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start a local development server and open the application in your default browser. If the browser does not open automatically, you can access the application by navigating to n http://localhost:5173/  in your browser.

## Additional Information
You can customize the React + Vite application by modifying the content, styling, and adding new components according to your needs. The application utilizes React, Vite, and the specified plugins for a fast and efficient development experience.
